# Webicity

Webicity is a simple web browser that I am working on (it is unfinished).

Webicity consists of multiple components:
* Webicity browser: Allows the user to directly launch Webicity, manages UI, disk, network, navigation and more
* Webicity: Responsible for rendering content
* Ribbon: Provides a GUI component system, and interfaces with the preferred drawing system
* Ribbon web: Part of Webicity. A web-oriented GUI component system based off of Ribbon.
* DoubleJ: Manages script execution
